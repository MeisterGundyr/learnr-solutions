for i in range(101): #range goes from 0 up to your number, so range(100) will give us 0 to 99. For 0 to 100 we need range(101). Remember though that this loop will now run *101 times*, so only do this if you specifically want 100 to be printed, not if you just want a loop to be run 100 times, as range(100) already achieves this 
    print(i)

#output: the numbers from 0 to 100
